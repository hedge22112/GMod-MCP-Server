# AGENTS.md

Shared agent guidance for this repository.

## Project

Two-part project: a GMod addon (`lua/`) and a .NET MCP server (`server/`). The repo IS the addon — `git clone` directly into `garrysmod/addons/` and GMod loads it. Anything outside `lua/`, `materials/`, `models/`, `sound/`, `resource/`, and the `addon.json` is ignored by the engine.

The bridge between the two halves is **file-based IPC** under `garrysmod/data/mcp/`. Pure Lua on the GMod side — no binary modules. See `docs/protocol.md` for the wire format.

## Module system

`lua/autorun/mcp.lua` bootstraps everything via `MCP:LoadFolder` with `sh_/cl_/sv_` prefix dispatch. Load order is intentional, deepest libraries first:

```
MCP:LoadFolder("libraries/libraries")
MCP:LoadFolder("libraries")
MCP:LoadFolder("functions")
```

Adding a library something else depends on means putting it deep enough that it loads first.

### Realm is implicit from file prefix

A `sh_lua_run.lua` is included on both server and client, so `MCP:AddFunction` runs once per realm. Don't add a `realm` field to the registration table — the framework reads `SERVER`/`CLIENT`. `sv_*` and `cl_*` files only register on their respective realm.

### Tool naming

The framework always appends `_sv` or `_cl` to the MCP tool name on the .NET side, so realm is always visible in the tool list. Don't include `_sv`/`_cl` in your `id` field. Likewise the .NET host appends `(server realm)`/`(client realm)` to every tool's `description`, so **don't state the realm in the description** — hand-writing "Server realm." is redundant (same principle as not hand-writing capability prose, below). Keep only cross-realm *semantics* worth knowing — how a `sh_` tool's `_sv` and `_cl` differ or agree (PVS divergence, client-prediction drift, identical results) — never the bare realm label.

Name a tool that's one of several acting on the same noun **subject-first, `<subject>_<op>`**, so the family sorts together: the read-half is `<subject>_state` (a rich structured read) and the write-half is `<subject>_set` — `entity_state`/`entity_set`, `player_state`/`player_set`, `game_state`/`game_set`, `cvar_state`/`cvar_set`. Other ops keep the subject-first verb form (`entity_find`, `player_walk`, `bot_spawn`). A true one-off belonging to no family is verb-first (`screenshot`, `reload_file`).

### Client bridge runs only for the listen-server host

The client-realm bridge serves the listen/SP **host** — the machine whose `data/mcp/` the .NET host shares. `IsListenServerHost()` needs a valid `LocalPlayer()` (not available at autorun), so the client bridge starts for everyone and a non-host client (a remote player on a listen server) stops its own bridge once `LocalPlayer()` becomes valid (`clientHostGate` in `sh_filebridge.lua`). Single-player is always the host. Consequence: dual-realm readiness (and the focus fix below) assume the local game is a listen/SP host — always true for a `host_launch`-started game.

## Capabilities

Sensitive tools declare `requires = { "<cap-id>" }` (whole-tool). Capabilities are registered with `MCP:AddCapability({ id = "...", default = false })` — the framework auto-derives the convar (`mcp_allow_<id>`) and creates it `FCVAR_PROTECTED | FCVAR_DONTRECORD | FCVAR_REPLICATED | FCVAR_ARCHIVE`. Replicated so server-side toggles propagate to clients; archived so user grants persist across game restarts. Don't reach for the convar directly; let the framework gate.

To gate **one argument** of an otherwise-ungated tool, declare `arg_requires = { [argName] = { "<cap-id>" } }`. Dispatch (`MCP:CheckCapabilities`) rejects that arg when ungranted but only if it's actually present, so the rest of the tool stays callable — `player_walk`'s caller-Lua `until` is the canonical case. Gated names must be declared schema properties (typos error at registration). Per-arg gates aren't carried in the manifest; the description is how clients learn of them.

For **both** levels the framework auto-appends the human note (`Requires the \`unsafe\` capability.`) to the tool/arg `description` at registration — so **don't hand-write capability prose**; declaring `requires`/`arg_requires` is enough, and the advertised note can't drift from the gate.

Built-in capabilities live in `lua/mcp/libraries/sh_capabilities.lua` — three: **`unsafe`** (arbitrary code: `lua_run`, `console_cmd`, `cvar_set`, `debug_record`/`debug_draw`), **`player_control`** (structured tools that drive the local player: `player_set`, `player_walk`), and **`world_control`** (structured world mutation: `entity_create`/`remove`/`set`, `game_set`, `bot_spawn`/`remove`). `lua_run` and `console_cmd` share `unsafe` because they're equivalent in power (Lua can `RunConsoleCommand`; the console can `lua_run` arbitrary Lua), so a single gate is honest rather than illusory granularity. Project-specific capabilities declare their own (e.g. TARDIS's `tardis_control`).

**Two gating axes: arbitrary-code (`unsafe`) and structured mutation (a write-cap).** `unsafe` is for tools that run caller-supplied Lua or wield arbitrary convar power: `lua_run` (and its `wait_until`/`wait_seconds`/`capture` args), `console_cmd`, `cvar_set` (it can flip `sv_cheats`/`sv_allowcslua`, so it's `console_cmd`-equivalent — curated *safe* convar knobs belong in `game_set`, not here), `debug_record`/`debug_draw`, and `player_walk`'s per-arg `until`/`sample_expr`. Separately, **a structured *mutator* is gated behind a bounded write-cap** — even though a typed `entity_set`/`player_set`/`game_set` can only do what its schema allows, *whether it may change the game at all* is the user's consent to give: **`player_control`** gates the tools that drive/reposition the local player (`player_set`, `player_walk`), **`world_control`** gates world mutation (`entity_create`/`remove`/`set`, `game_set` on both realms, `bot_spawn`/`remove`). Player is split off because it takes over the user's own avatar. **Reads are always ungated** — `entity_state`/`find`, `player_state`/`trace`, `game_state`, `cvar_state`, `world_trace`, `model_info`, `console_read`, `screenshot`, and the `debug_clear` janitor; `reload_file` is ungated too, since it re-runs already-installed on-disk code with no caller-supplied Lua. All caps default `false` (opt-in; archived so a grant persists). A tool that both reads and mutates gates on the mutation. Layering composes: `player_walk` needs `player_control` to run at all *and additionally* `unsafe` for its `until`/`sample_expr` args (whole-tool `requires` checked first, then per-arg).

**Never bypass the capability gate with cross-realm code.** Never route caller-supplied Lua from a **client** realm to the **server** realm over `net` for the server to run: a `net.Receive` doesn't pass through `MCP:CheckCapabilities`, so it bypasses the gate entirely and escalates client power to server authority (an RCE). Cross-realm code crosses **only through the bridge** — arm each realm as its own capability-gated tool, correlate by a caller `link_id`; the `net` channel carries only non-code signals + result data, host-gated on `ply:IsListenServerHost()`. Server→client code *is* sanctioned (the trusted direction — the engine's own `SendLua` already permits it), e.g. `player_lua_run`.

## Deferred waits (RunFor / Settle)

A handler that must wait for an effect across frames defers (`return ctx.deferred`) and resolves later via `ctx.respond`. Two shared primitives in `lua/mcp/libraries/libraries/sh_runfor.lua` drive these — both RealTime + `Think`, never `timer.Simple`:

- `MCP:RunFor(opts, onDone)` — the base bounded per-frame loop: runs `on_each(elapsed)` and/or polls `stop(elapsed)` each frame up to `seconds`; resolves once with `reason` = `stop` / `duration` / `error` (`on_each`/`stop` are pcall'd; a throw ends it as `error`). The windowed-loop core for sample-per-frame tools.
- `MCP:Settle(opts, onDone)` — layered on RunFor: resolves when `check(elapsed)` has held **continuously** for `stable_for` (the dwell, so a transient blip can't false-settle), else times out. The caller supplies `check` because the harness can't know what "settled" means — velocity for poses, existence for removes. `settled = (reason == "stop")`.

A tool's `seconds` must sit under its declared `timeout` (per-tool request timeout) or the .NET host abandons the call before the wait finishes. **Gate stillness on velocity, not per-frame position** — a from-rest drop starts at ~0 speed, so a position gate false-settles before the fall accelerates. Consumers: `player_set`, `bot_remove`. (`bot_spawn`'s multi-phase respawn is a deliberately frame-counted state machine, not a settle, so it stays hand-rolled.)

## Async jobs (asyncable / job_collect)

Any tool that defers can opt into running its wait as a **background job** instead of blocking the call: declare `asyncable = true` in the `AddFunction` table and the framework advertises a universal `async` boolean arg. Called with `async = true`, `MCP:Dispatch` mints a job, points `ctx.respond` at a job-registry slot instead of the bridge's `respondLater`, and returns `{ job_id, status = "armed" }` **at once** when the handler defers; the handler code is otherwise untouched (the `async` arg injection is a single wrap of the schema at registration, `sh_module.lua`). Blocking stays the default, so nothing existing changes.

Why it exists: a blocking wait can't be interleaved with the tool calls that CAUSE its condition (you can't issue them while blocked), and no single blocking call can exceed the host's ~60 s ceiling (`RunFor` clamps at `HARD_MAX_SECONDS = 60` too). Async removes both limits.

- **Registry** (`lua/mcp/libraries/libraries/sh_jobs.lua`, per-realm): `MCP._jobs` keyed by `mcp_job_<seq>`; `RegisterJob`/`CompleteJob` (guarded on `armed`, idempotent)/`CancelJob`/`SweepJobs` (TTL-reaps finished ~300 s, and orphaned armed past `deadline`). Modelled on the interactive recorder's arm → slot → fill → collect/forget → sweep lifecycle, generalized.
- **`job_collect` / `job_cancel` / `job_list`** (`functions/sh_job_*.lua`, both realms, **ungated** — they only touch a slot the already-gated `async` arm made). `job_collect` block-or-polls (returns the tool's own result verbatim, same shape as a sync call; forgets on collect; `pending` to re-poll) — the exact debug_record_read shape. Collect on the realm you armed.
- **Passive completion**: `CompleteJob` pushes a `kind = "job"` event onto the events ring (`RecordEvent`, `sh_capture.lua`), so a finish rides the **next** tool response's `events` and shows in `console_read` — the model learns a job finished without polling. Lightweight notice (job_id + ok/error + a `path` if present); the full result stays in `job_collect`. This is the same rail passive console/error output uses (there is no server→model push).
- **Cancellation seam**: an asyncable tool registers `ctx.onCancel(teardown)` — teardown removes its hooks / releases side effects but does **not** respond (the registry owns the terminal state). `RunFor`/`Settle` now return a silent-cancel closure for RunFor-based tools; hand-rolled tools pass their own cleanup. `onCancel` is optional — without it cancel is "soft" (mark cancelled, let the tool's own cap expire the hooks).
- **.NET**: a media tool returning a `content` array skips the whole-result JSON dump, so `BuildContent` (`Program.cs`) explicitly re-surfaces `events` as a trailing text block — else a passive job completion landing on an inline-screenshot response would be dropped (its cursor already advanced).

Asyncable tools: **`screenshot`, `lua_run`, `player_walk`, `debug_record`, `player_lua_run`** — the long/conditional waiters. The sub-2 s settle mutators (`cvar_set`, `player_set`, `entity_set`/`remove`, `bot_remove`) are deliberately **not** asyncable: they settle before you could interleave anything and never approach the 60 s ceiling. Adding a new asyncable tool is a flag plus an optional `ctx.onCancel` line.

## Tooling

- `.luarc.json` configures sumneko-LuaLS with `./.tools/glua-api` (GLua type stubs).

## .NET side

Built with the official `ModelContextProtocol` C# SDK + Generic Host. `server/GModMcpServer/Program.cs` wires `.AddMcpServer().WithStdioServerTransport()`, watches `garrysmod/data/mcp/manifest_server.json` and `manifest_client.json` (one per realm; the host merges them), and forwards `tools/call` requests through `FileBridge`.

```bash
cd server/GModMcpServer
dotnet build
dotnet run    # for local development
```

**Building requires no MCP host holding these binaries open.** A running host — `dotnet run`, or the GMod MCP server registered in *any* agent or MCP Inspector session pointed at this build — keeps `bin/.../GModMcpServer.dll` locked, so `dotnet build` / `dotnet test` fails with a file-in-use error. Disable or stop the MCP server in **every** active session (and anywhere else it's running) before building, then re-enable it after.

**Workaround to build/test without stopping the server: use `-c Release`.** The live host loads `bin/Debug/net10.0/GModMcpServer.dll`, so a Release build/test writes to the separate `bin/Release/net10.0/` path the running Debug host isn't holding — the suite runs with the MCP server still enabled (`dotnet test server/GModMcpServer.Tests/GModMcpServer.Tests.csproj -c Release`; add `--no-build` on repeat runs). Only works while Debug is the live config; flip if the host is ever registered from a Release build.

Tests live in `server/GModMcpServer.Tests/` (NUnit 4). Run with `dotnet test server/GModMcpServer.Tests/GModMcpServer.Tests.csproj` from the repo root. Coverage focuses on `MergedManifest.Equals`, `FileBridge` round-trips against a `FakeGmodResponder`, and `ManifestWatcher` change detection. `GameProcessManager` and the host tools (`Launch`/`Close`/`Status`) aren't unit-tested — they wrap the OS process layer and the live file bridge respectively.

Two categories of tool exist on the .NET side:
- **Host tools** (`server/GModMcpServer/Host/Tools/`) — implemented in-process, available even when GMod isn't running: `host_launch`, `host_close`, `host_status`. `host_changelevel` also lives here but needs a running game — it changes the live map and blocks until the new map is ready (the in-game sibling of `host_launch`'s readiness wait). `mcp_reload` is also here — the host-managed addon reload (re-runs the Lua, restarts the bridge, then waits for both realms via the `_generation` bump in `_ping`); it's named for the console command it wraps, *not* `host_*`, because it reloads the addon, not the game. It exists because the bare console `mcp_reload` tears the bridge down mid-call and times out the triggering caller.
- **Bridge tools** — declared by GMod via `MCP:AddFunction`, dispatched through the file IPC. Names always end in `_sv` or `_cl` so realm is visible.

`host_status` issues a live `_ping` round-trip when GMod is detected so the MCP client can distinguish "running but bridge unreachable" from "running but `mcp_enable` is off." See `docs/protocol.md` for the wire format.

### Tool-list generation (README)

The **Tools** tables in `README.md` are auto-generated — the prose around them is normal README text, but the three tables (between the `<!-- TOOLS:HOST -->`, `<!-- TOOLS:GAME -->`, `<!-- TOOLS:CAPS -->` marker pairs) are not hand-edited. `server/GModMcpServer.ToolList` builds them game-independently: it reflects the host tools via `HostToolCatalog.Describe()` and recovers the GMod bridge tools by running the addon's registration code headlessly under MoonSharp (`LuaToolDump` stubs the few globals touched at file-load, loads `sh_` in both realms, then calls the real `MCP:BuildManifest()`). MoonSharp is a dependency of the generator only, never the shipping server.

`HostToolCatalog.ToolTypes` is the single source of truth for host tools — Program.cs registers DI from it and the generator reflects from it, so a new host tool is picked up by both. Regenerate with `dotnet run --project server/GModMcpServer.ToolList` (`--check` exits non-zero if stale, for CI). The `tool-list.yml` workflow regenerates and auto-commits on push to main (pushing with `GENERATE_DOCS_TOKEN`, a PAT, since `main`'s branch-protection ruleset blocks the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

Two rules when adding a tool the generator has to handle. **(1) Generate only data:** the generated regions are just the three tables — all prose (intro, links, per-section descriptions) stays hand-written in the README outside the markers, never baked into the generator. **(2) Keep a tool file's load-time code bare:** at file load do only `MCP:AddFunction({...})` with a literal schema. The generator runs each registration headlessly under MoonSharp with a minimal stub env, so any game global touched *at load* — `isnumber`/`IsValid`/`pairs(_G)`, enum constants like `SOLID_*`/`COLLISION_GROUP_*` — is nil and throws, crashing generation. Build any computed table (enum reverse-maps, capability lists) **lazily on first handler call** and cache; the handler never runs at load, so game globals are fine there.

## Hot reload

Editing an existing Lua tool file is enough — no console command needed. GMod's autorefresh re-runs the file, `MCP:AddFunction` is idempotent and updates the registry in place, then a debounced 100 ms timer writes a fresh manifest. The .NET host's `ManifestWatcher` notices the content delta and pushes `notifications/tools/list_changed` to the connected MCP client.

`mcp_reload` is still available for forced rebuilds (e.g. when a tool file has been *deleted* — autorefresh has nothing to fire on for removals, and for a brand-*new* file on **either realm**, which `mcp_reload` picks up because `MCP:Reload` re-runs `LoadFolder("functions")` in both realms — on the listen/SP host the client `include`s new files straight off the shared disk, so a brand-new *client* tool hot-loads with no relaunch too, verified 2026-06-30 with `entity_find_cl`). It comes in two forms: the in-game console command, and the host-managed `mcp_reload` MCP tool (above) which waits for the bridge to come back — prefer the tool from an MCP client, since the bare console reload restarts the bridge mid-call and times the caller out.

**Adding, renaming, or removing a tool now propagates mid-session — no restart needed.** We advertise `capabilities.tools.listChanged: true` (set in `Program.cs` via a post-`Configure`; the SDK's manual `WithListToolsHandler` path leaves the flag off, only the attribute/collection path auto-sets it). With it advertised, the manifest-delta `notifications/tools/list_changed` actually takes effect: verified live 2026-06-29 on Claude Code v2.1.195 — a runtime-registered tool was callable **within the same turn**, and a removed one vanished. The old "must restart" belief was *our* bug, not Claude Code's: CC correctly gates on the advertised capability, which we never sent. CC's handling of it has been historically flaky (anthropics/claude-code#4118, #31893), so a restart stays the fallback if a new tool ever fails to appear. Game-side caveat unchanged: a brand-*new* file (or a deletion) still needs `mcp_reload` to load/clear it — autorefresh only fires for edits to existing files — but once the manifest changes, CC picks it up without a restart. *Editing the body of an already-registered tool* needs nothing — autorefresh updates the handler and the known name/schema still dispatches. (Distinct from the genuinely-unsupported `notifications/message` server→model channel: Claude Code surfaces **no** unsolicited MCP notification to the model — only tool results reach it — so passive console/error output rides back on the next tool result's `events` field + the `console_read` poll tools, never a push. That feature request is closed *not-planned*; don't propose a push channel to make the model *see* something.)

ConVar values (capability gates, `mcp_enable`) are `FCVAR_ARCHIVE` so they persist across reloads. Persisting across a game *restart* additionally needs a clean shutdown: GMod writes its archived server convars to `cfg/server.vdf` only on a proper window-close, so `host_close` does that by default (see Process tracking) — a force-kill loses any grants set that session.

## Remote servers over ssh (`--ssh`)

`--ssh <dest>[:<data path>]` points the host at a remote server's `garrysmod/data` instead of a local install. It is the same file protocol with a different transport, so the Lua side is unchanged. The one addition is `dedicated` on the server `_ping`.

- **Transport** (`server/GModMcpServer/Remote/`): `SshAgent` runs one long-lived system `ssh` session (so the user's config, keys and agent apply; `BatchMode=yes` because there's no terminal to prompt on) and sends `agent.sh`, an embedded resource, as the remote command. The script travels base64 in the command line, which keeps stdin free for the line protocol documented at its top. The remote needs only bash 4+ and coreutils.
- **Responses are pushed, not polled.** `SshBridge` registers a one-shot `watch` on its response file before writing the request, and the agent emits the file the moment it's non-empty. A file caught mid-write fails to parse and is simply re-watched. The manifests use `track` instead, re-pushed whenever their `cksum` changes, and `ManifestWatcher` has a remote constructor fed by it.
- **console.log** goes through `ILogFile` (`LocalLogFile` / `RemoteLogFile`), so `EngineLogReader`'s cursor logic is shared. `RemoteLogFile` throws when the session is down rather than returning "missing": a missing file resets the passive cursor to 0, which would replay the whole log on reconnect.
- **Reconnect**: the supervisor restarts ssh with backoff and re-sends outstanding watches and tracks on the agent's `hello`. Tagged requests in flight fail with the ssh error. Startup waits only for the first attempt, so an unreachable host fails fast instead of stalling the MCP handshake.
- **Dedicated servers have no client realm** (see "Client bridge runs only for the listen-server host"). The server `_ping` reports `dedicated`, and the readiness waits (`WaitUntilReadyAsync`, `mcp_reload`) then stop pinging the client, which would otherwise always time out. The `level_change.json` marker is honoured on dedicated servers too, since only `_changelevel` ever writes it there.
- **Host tools**: `host_launch`/`host_close` return `HostToolHelpers.RemoteUnsupported`. `host_status` has a remote branch that lists srcds processes whose `/proc/<pid>/cwd` is this install's game root, and reads `-condebug` from their command line.
- **Tests** (`SshRemoteTests`) run the real `agent.sh` with a local bash standing in for ssh (the internal `SshAgent` constructor), so CI exercises the protocol end to end. On Windows they use Git Bash and pass the command through the environment, because MSYS re-parses a Windows command line differently from `ssh.exe`.

## Multi-host file IPC

Multiple .NET MCP hosts can share the same GMod data dir (e.g. Claude Code + MCP Inspector running side-by-side). Each .NET host generates a per-process session GUID at startup and prefixes every request id with `<session>__`, so the response files are filtered by glob and never poach each other. GMod treats the prefixed id as opaque and echoes it back in the response filename. Cleanup of `mcp/<realm>/in,out/` happens in `MCP:StartBridge` (init + `mcp_reload`), so crashed-host orphans are reaped on next reload — no TTL janitor needed.

## Process tracking (host_launch / host_close)

`GameProcessManager` finds GMod via `Process.GetProcessesByName("gmod")` rather than holding the handle returned by `Process.Start`. The launcher chain re-execs itself within seconds on Windows, so the original handle goes stale fast — but only one `gmod.exe` is ever running at a time (Steam blocks duplicates), so a name lookup is both reliable and survives .NET host restarts. `_lastArgs` is in-memory state — populated only when *this* .NET process called Launch — and is informational.

`host_close` defaults to a **clean** shutdown so GMod saves its config (capability grants / `mcp_enable` → `cfg/server.vdf`, written only on a real window-close). Lua can't quit (the engine blocklists `quit` on every Lua path: `game.ConsoleCommand`, `RunConsoleCommand`, `Player:ConCommand`) and a raw `WM_CLOSE` is ignored, so it posts the X-button signal (`WM_SYSCOMMAND`/`SC_CLOSE`) to the visible "Garry's Mod" window — found by enumerating top-level windows across all gmod PIDs, since the launcher spawns several (CEF/Steam helpers) and `MainWindowHandle` is unreliable. It waits up to `graceful_seconds` (default 10) for the tree to exit, then falls back to a kill; `force: true` skips straight to the kill (no config save). The clean path is Windows-only (`OperatingSystem.IsWindows()`-guarded); other platforms kill.

### Focus handling on launch (`host_launch` `background`)

GMod grabs the OS foreground at **window creation** (early, well before bridge readiness). Whether that's wanted depends on intent, so a single `background` arg (Windows-only) drives all the focus handling; there is no separate `fix_focus` knob.

Everything here leans on one primitive: `GameProcessManager.SetForegroundForced` — a `SetForegroundWindow` wrapped in the **`AttachThreadInput` trick** (attach our input queue to the *current* foreground window's thread for the call; it may even report false yet still take effect). A *plain* `SetForegroundWindow` from this long-lived background host is **silently blocked by Windows' foreground lock** whenever another process holds/asserts the foreground — GMod during its startup grab (live: 51 futile demotes, GMod held ~7 s), OR a window the user is actively clicking (live: 4 plain flickers failed mid-click and the mouse stayed stuck). The forced version wins in one shot, with a **clean refocus afterwards** (no FPS/mouse-look corruption — unlike the **rejected** synthetic `WM_KILLFOCUS`/`WM_ACTIVATE` deactivate messages, which free the mouse but wreck the next real refocus).

`background: false` (**default**, "foreground launch"): GMod is allowed to come to the front. After readiness, `ReconcileFocusAsync` checks for the **stuck-mouse glitch** — the GMod/SDL bug where, if focus is lost during the startup race, GMod misses the OS focus-lost event, keeps its cached focus flag "focused", and grabs the mouse (relative-mouse recenter) *while backgrounded*. Signature: `GameProcessManager.IsForeground()` false **and** the client realm's `_ping` `has_focus = true` (a *clean* background, `has_focus = false` — e.g. the user deliberately alt-tabbed away — is not the glitch and is left alone). On a hit it heals by bringing GMod **legitimately to the foreground** (`FocusGame`), so the mouse grab is correct because the game really is the active window — consistent with "foreground launch". `has_focus` lies (stays true) during the glitch, so it's only a *detector*, never trusted as truth.

`background: true` ("keep my window", for the MCP-from-fullscreen-RDP workflow): never steal focus. `host_launch` captures `CaptureForegroundWindow()` *before* `Launch`, then a concurrent watcher (`WatchForegroundAsync`, ~120 ms) calls `DemoteFromForeground(userWindow)` throughout the readiness wait, restoring the user's window whenever GMod grabs it. A **single** forced restore sticks (GMod asserts the foreground only once, at creation, and doesn't re-grab), leaving GMod **cleanly unfocused** (`has_focus = false`, no mouse grab); validated `demotes = 1` with a 200 ms logger **never once** catching GMod foreground. Needs `wait_for_bridge` (the watcher rides the readiness wait). The post-readiness reconcile then finds the stuck signature for this mode and would flicker (`FlickerFocus`: forced focus-in → settle → restore the user's window) to free the mouse — but in practice the watcher already prevented the stuck state, so it no-ops.

Reported back in the `background_focus` (watcher) and `focus_reconcile` (`action`: `none` / `focus_game` / `flicker`) result blocks.

`host_launch` and `host_changelevel` wait for **both** realms to report ready before returning (`BridgePinger.WaitUntilReadyAsync` polls server + client each tick, fail-fast on either realm's `bootstrap_error`). The client realm only needs to be reachable with `mcp_enable` on (bootstrap state is server-side) and is where `has_focus` comes from.

Edit it there, not in this file; the block below is overwritten by CI. Addon-specific guidance lives outside the markers._

## Code style

- **Pure Lua syntax only - no GMod-Lua extensions.** No `//` comments, no `continue`, no `!=`, no `&&`/`||`. Use `--`, `goto skip` (`continue` is a reserved word even as a `goto` label, so `goto continue` fails at load), `~=`, `and`/`or`.
- **Comments: concise, the _why_ not the _what_.** A couple of lines at most; reserve length for genuinely non-obvious rationale and bias toward cutting - match the surrounding density, don't pad to essay length. Don't restate the code, don't explain it by what it replaced, and keep the _why_ self-contained (no pointers to external docs or fragile cross-file references). Keep comments ASCII: `->` not an arrow, a single spaced hyphen for a dash (never a double `--`, which reads as a second comment marker, nor an em-dash).
- **Drop the loop variable you don't use** rather than naming it: `for _, v in pairs(t)`, `for k in pairs(t)`, `for _ = 1, n do`. The `unused` lint is on - keep the noise floor at zero.
- **Every `---@diagnostic disable` needs a paired reason** on the same or preceding line naming _why_ the rule is suppressed. The default is to fix the issue, not suppress it.
- **If that reason is an analyzer or annotations defect rather than our code, start it `glua_ls <version>:`** - and do the same for a `---@cast` / `---@type` / `--[[@as]]` that only exists to work around one. `grep -rn "glua_ls <version>"` is then the complete list to re-test on a toolchain bump, and anything unmarked is a genuine local decision. Without it there is no way to tell the two apart, and a workaround outlives the bug it was written for.

## First-time setup (before touching `.lua` files)

The tooling (`glua_check`, `glua_ls`, the GLua API stubs, and the wiki/typing type-model) is provisioned by the shared [`gmod-addon-tools`](https://github.com/AmyJeanes/gmod-addon-tools) module, cloned **beside this addon**. `scripts/install-tools.ps1` is a thin wrapper - `scripts/bootstrap.ps1` resolves the sibling module and it calls `Initialize-GmodTools`, so the version pins live once in the module and every addon runs the exact same engine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmyJeanes/gmod-addon-tools ../gmod-addon-tools
pwsh -File scripts/install-tools.ps1
```

It is idempotent - re-running is a no-op when the pinned versions are already present, so it is also the recovery path when diagnostics look wrong. In Claude Code, run `/reload-plugins` after a fresh install so the live LSP restarts against the new binary. Codex does not need a reload because it uses the project-local tools for explicit checks rather than a live LSP session.

### `.luarc.json` library entries

Reference a sibling's subdirectories - `../Doors/lua` **and** `../Doors/.luatypes` - never `../Doors` itself. Each addon provisions its own `.tools/glua-api`, so a root entry loads the annotations twice, which breaks `@return_cast` narrowing and misreports types at sites with no visible link to libraries ([gmod-glua-ls#48](https://github.com/Pollux12/gmod-glua-ls/issues/48)). Omitting a sibling's `.luatypes` silently drops its type overrides. `Initialize-GmodTools` fails on both.

### `.luatypes` files must abort if executed

They declare real globals and functions with empty bodies (`CPPI = {}`, `function debug.getinfo(...) end`), so executing one replaces working code with stubs. Living outside `lua/` is what keeps them unreachable - the game mounts, and `gmad` packs, from a fixed folder whitelist - so leave them there. Each also carries a guard as its first executable line, which `Initialize-GmodTools` enforces and the analyzer ignores:

```lua
error("cppi.lua contains type annotations only and must never be executed")
```

## GLua analyzer integration (`glua-lsp` plugin)

The [`glua-lsp` plugin](https://github.com/AmyJeanes/gmod-agent-plugins) distributes the shared GLua setup and recovery skills to Claude Code and Codex. Both agents use the same project-local [`glua_ls`](https://github.com/Pollux12/gmod-glua-ls), `glua_check`, and API stubs under `.tools/`; no global install or PATH plumbing is required.

Claude Code also uses the plugin for live diagnostics, hover, and jump-to-definition. Diagnostics arrive automatically after every edit. `.claude/settings.json` declares the `gmod-agent-plugins` marketplace so contributors are prompted to install it on first open, and the plugin resolves `glua_ls` from this project's `.tools/bin/` when it launches. Codex does not currently expose a live LSP integration, so use `scripts/glua-check.ps1` for repository diagnostics there. The `glua-lsp:install-glua-ls` skill covers the same provisioning and recovery flow in either agent. Treat diagnostics as actionable only when the current change caused them; pre-existing noise on unrelated lines is outside scope.

## Whole-repo scans (`scripts/glua-check.ps1`)

`glua_ls` only analyzes files as they are opened or edited. To audit the whole repo at once, run `pwsh -File scripts/glua-check.ps1` - it provisions tooling on demand (no-op when present) and runs `glua_check --warnings-as-errors` against the workspace root. It takes no path filter, so it always scans everything; CI runs the same script. Useful after a fix ripples across the tree, or when picking the project up to surface latent issues the LSP hasn't opened yet. Count the diagnostics rather than trusting the exit code: `hint` sits below `--warnings-as-errors`, so a hint-level regression still prints `Check successful` and exits 0.

**Local and CI can disagree, and CI is authoritative** - but `glua_check` itself is platform-consistent (verified against the Linux binary), so suspect a difference in *what is being analyzed* before suspecting the analyzer: a duplicate annotations copy on the library masks undeclared engine classnames locally, for instance. Declare those in `.luatypes` as `---@class <name> : Entity`. What does diverge is the generated hook catalogue, which resolves types through `glua_doc_cli` rather than `glua_check` - hence CI owning that file, and never regenerating it locally. Avoid a strict `---@class`/`---@type` on a *partial or reused literal*; use `table`/`table[]?` or a `--[[@as Class]]` cast instead.

## Typing enforcement (`scripts/typing-check.ps1`)

`glua_check` catches _wrong_ types but not _missing_ ones - an untyped param is a silent `any` it never flags. `Test-GmodTyping` (CI: `typing-check.yml`) closes that gap, failing the build on any of: an untyped param, annotation rot (a `---@param` for a param that no longer exists), a modeled function whose resolved return type contains `unknown`, a hook fire-site argument that resolves to `unknown`, or a `:CallHook`-style hook whose receiver resolves to `unknown` (so its "Fired on" column would render _Unknown_ - usually fixed with a `---@param self <class>` on the enclosing function). Satisfy it at the **source** - prefer a `---@param` / `---@return` / `---@class` annotation over a per-callsite `---@cast`, since annotations propagate to every caller. The only accepted escapes are explicit and greppable: `---@param x any` (a reviewed, genuine `any`), an `_` discard for a deliberately-unused arg, and a file-level `---@vendored` marker on third-party code.

**Codex must run `scripts/typing-check.ps1` outside its command sandbox** (`sandbox_permissions: "require_escalated"`). The hook-surface phase starts `glua_ls` over the addon's sibling workspace libraries; inside Codex's filesystem sandbox indexing can exhaust the 150-second enrich cap even when the same check passes in seconds without the sandbox. Treat that cap as an environment failure and rerun with escalation rather than increasing the timeout. Claude Code and ordinary terminals do not need this accommodation.

Where an addon fires its own hooks, callback payload params are typed by a generated `---@overload` catalogue (`scripts/generate-hook-types.ps1`, CI: `generate-hook-types.yml`) - do not hand-edit it; retype a payload at its `CallHook` / `hook.Run` site instead. Custom global-hook overloads are spliced into the provisioned `hook.lua` by `Initialize-GmodTools`, so after pulling a change to a generated fragment mid-session, re-run `scripts/install-tools.ps1` to re-sync it. In Claude Code, then run `/reload-plugins` to refresh the live types.

## Before reporting a `glua_ls` bug

The two gates disagree by design: `Test-GmodTyping` only asks whether a param is typed at all, which an `---@overload` match satisfies; `infer-unknown` additionally asks whether it was _declared_, which an overload match is not. So a hook callback can pass typing-check and still trip `infer-unknown` on values derived from its params - an explicit `---@param` above the `hook.Add` clears it. This hits stock GMod hooks too, not just generated catalogues.

A committed `---@diagnostic disable` marks a genuine analyzer bug - it fired, and was suppressed. A `---@cast` / `---@type` / `--[[@as]]` frequently does not; it is often a redundant defensive leftover. Remove it in the real workspace and re-check before concluding anything - but **four** things read these annotations and only two of them run locally:

- `glua_check` - **count the diagnostics, never the exit code**; `hint` sits below `--warnings-as-errors`, so a hint-level regression still prints `Check successful` and exits 0.
- `Test-GmodTyping` - hook fire-site arguments `glua_check` never mentions.
- the generated hook catalogue - it resolves `CallHook` / `hook.Run` argument types and only regenerates in CI, so deleting a cast that fed one has turned `main` red with no local signal at all.
- a generated wiki - a `---@field` can decide a *published* type, and nothing gates it: the workflow regenerates and commits rather than failing on drift. One deletion downgraded a rendered `linked_portal_door` to `Entity` with both code gates green.

`Test-GmodAnnotation` measures all four - it removes the annotation, re-measures each, restores, and reports which moved (an inline `--[[@as T]]` has its token stripped rather than its line deleted):

```powershell
pwsh -c ". ./scripts/bootstrap.ps1; Test-GmodAnnotation -RepoRoot . -Site 'lua/foo.lua:270'"
```

Suppressions tracking an upstream report carry a `glua_ls upstream:` comment with the issue URL, so grep that to find what to retire when one closes.

Already investigated and **not** bugs, so do not re-derive them: `pcall` never narrows on `ok` (a limitation every Lua type system shares); `table.Copy` is genuinely generic, and its casts suppress `need-check-nil` because the return is honestly `T?`; `string.gmatch`'s bare `---@return function` makes a local `---@type fun(): string` a real tightening rather than a workaround; the undocumented Derma / `DModelPanel` getters are correctly omitted from the stubs; and a runtime-conditional `ENT.Base` (Wire mounted or not) cannot be resolved statically, though that no longer costs a suppression - wire came off the analysis surface and the symbols we use are declared instead.

## Bumping the shared tooling

Tool versions and this conventions block are pinned to a `gmod-addon-tools` tag. Bump the version constants in `gmod-addon-tools/src/install.ps1` (or edit the shared docs); merging to the module's `main` auto-cuts a new tag, and Renovate then raises a pin-bump PR here that regenerates the affected artifacts and runs GLua Check before it merges. CI pins the module by tag (the `ref:` in each workflow); a local sibling checkout uses whatever branch it is on, so keep it on the pinned tag to mirror CI exactly.
